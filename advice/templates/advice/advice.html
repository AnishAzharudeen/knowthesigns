      <p class="reason">
        Human trafficking and modern slavery are severe human rights violations
        affecting millions worldwide. These crimes involve exploiting
        individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for labor or sex.
      </p>
      <p class="reason">
        Prevention and awareness are crucial due to the scale and hidden nature
        of the problem.
      </p>
      <p class="reason">
        An estimated 21 million people globally are trapped in modern slavery,
        with victims often unable to seek help due to language barriers or fear.
        Natural disasters and political instability can increase vulnerability
        to trafficking, while over 40% of U.S. trafficking investigations
        involve child sexual exploitation.
      </p>
      <p class="reason">
        The economic impact is significant, as trafficking occurs in various
        sectors including domestic work, factories, and agriculture.
      </p>
      <p class="reason">
        Raising awareness helps communities recognize signs of trafficking,
        potentially saving lives. Prevention efforts, such as education and
        addressing root causes like poverty and lack of opportunities, are
        essential in combating this global issue.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="reason">
        By understanding and actively working against human trafficking, we can
        protect vulnerable individuals and create a safer, more just world for
        all.
