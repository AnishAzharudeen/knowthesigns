## PROJECT DESIGN

  ### Wireframes

   The initial wireframes were created in [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLsxo6qA=/) to understand how the site would work, and this layout would drive User Stories, the logic required and overall design artwork decisions.


<span style="justify-content:space-between; align-items:top;">

       * Define Media Storage URL
       * Set DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
       * Set DATABASES
       * set STRIPE settings
    

  ### Deployment to Heroku involved the following steps and changes:
   1. Install gunicorn and psycopg2 then freeze requirements to requirements.txt.
   2. Create a Procfile (web: gunicorn core.wsgi:application).
   3. Log into your Heroku account, create a new app, and access the dashboard for your application.
