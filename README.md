## PROJECT DESIGN

  ### Wireframes

   The initial wireframes were created in [Miro](https://miro.com/es/) to understand how the site would work, and this layout would drive User Stories, the logic required and overall design artwork decisions.

  ### Logic
  The database schema and website logic was conceived and created using [Lucid](https://lucid.app/) as follows:

  Database Structure:

  ### Color Scheme
  The main colours of orange, dark blue and white were chosen for maximum contrast. I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co) to generate a colour palette.


  I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to generate a logo and a style guide.

## DEPLOYMENT
  for a deployment, keep in mind that depending on the functionalities, some extra configuration may be missing. Very important is the configuration of variables in Heroku and the add-ons since without these activated you will not be able to see the project correctly

  Initially, Django was installed following this Code Institute [DRF Cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LCLxWhmW_4VTE4GXsnHgmPUwSPKNT4KyMxSH8agbVqU/edit#heading=h.mpopj7v69qqn)

   1. Create a Cloudinary account and gather API key
   2. Create ElephantSQL database and gather API key
   3. Install Django
   4. Create project
   5. Install Cloudinary Storage
   6. Install Pillow (image processing)
   7. Update INSTALLED_APPs
       * all apps in the django project must be make migrations
       * python manage.py makemigrations
       * python manage.py migrate
       * to pass external data to the models if you need it.
          - create the fixture folder
          - add your file.json to the folder
          - python manage.py loaddata 'name.json' 
   8. Create env.py file
       * Add CLOUDINARY_KEY (from Cloudinary API key)
       * Add SECRET_KEY - (a unique password)
       * ADD DATABASE_URL - (postgres ElephantSQL API key)
       * STRIPE_SECRET_KEY 
       * STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY 
       * DEBUG = True (if you have to push to heroku set False)
   9. Update settings.py
       * CLOUDINARY_STORAGE
       * Define Media Storage URL
       * Set DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
       * Set DATABASES
       * set STRIPE settings
    

  ### Deployment to Heroku involved the following steps and changes:
   1. Set up DEBUG in settins.py to False
   2. install gunicorn ==22.0.0
   3. Create a Procfile (web: gunicorn core.wsgi:application) 
   4. Create a runtime.txt file and add the following: Python-3.12.3
   5. Terminate all servers.
       * Ensure DEBUG and DEV in env.py are commented out
       * python3 manage.py runserver
   6. Check project is displaying in the preview on port 8000 or gitpod
   7. Log into your Heroku account, create a new app, and access the dashboard for your application
   8. Go to Settings and open the Config Vars add all the Api keys in your env.py
       * Add CLOUDINARY_KEY (the Cloudinary API key)
       * Add SECRET_KEY - (the unique password)
       * Add DATABASE_URL - (postgres ElephantSQL API key)
       * Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY - (stripe payments Api key)
   9. Ensure your application has an ALLOWED_HOST your '.herokuapp.com' - '.gitpod.io'
   10. Ensure in Resources in heroku dasboard change your dinos active.

## FORKING AND CLONING INSTRUCTIONS
You can create a copy of a GitHub Repository without affecting the original by forking or cloning it.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to forking:
Forking is often used for proposing changes or using the project as a starting point for your own idea. Forking will apear on your GitHub profile.
1. Log into GitHub or sign up for an account.
2. Go to the [Iron Haven Fitness Repository](https://github.com/richard9106/Project-5)
3. Click "Fork" on the right side of the repository's page to create a copy in your own repository.

### Here's a step-by-step guide to cloning:
Cloning is often used for experimenting locally.  It will not show up on your GitHub profile.
1. Go to the [Iron Haven Fitness Repository](https://github.com/richard9106/Project-5)
2. Click the green code button, then the arrow, and select the "clone by https" option to copy the URL.
3. Open your preferred code editor and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Type 'git clone', paste the copied URL, and press enter. The repository will then be cloned to your machine.
