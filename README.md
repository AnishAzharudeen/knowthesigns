# KnowTheSigns

KnowTheSigns is an anonymouse reporting website for victims and people who suspect human trafficking. 
Reports are reviewed by trained staff who ensure that proper action is taken.

Stories of inspiration can also be found on the website for victims. 
Additionally, there is a page dedicated on advice to recognise exploitation in others.
