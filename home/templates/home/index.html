              Miguel, enslaved in Florida's orange groves, endured threats and
              exploitation after seeking work to pay for his son's cancer
              treatment. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers discovered his

              his own terms, enjoys time off, and sends money to his family.
              Most importantly, his son has recovered and is healthy.

              Flor Molina was trafficked from Mexico to a garment factory in Los
              Angeles, where she faced abuse and 18-hour workdays. After
              pleading to attend church, she escaped and cooperated with federal
              authorities investigating the factory. Flor was granted a T visa
              to remain in the U.S. She has since become an advocate for
              trafficking survivors, using her voice to represent those who
              cannot speak for themselves.

              away and found help through a priest who contacted the police.
              Today, Evelyn is a survivor activist and board member of The Human
              Trafficking Legal Center, working to combat modern slavery and
              sharing her story to raise awareness and inspire change.
